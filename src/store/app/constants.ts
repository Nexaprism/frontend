export const metaverseDescription = "The metaverse is a catch-all phrase for just about anything\n\
related to nascent technology and how we plan to interact with it.\n\
Is it VR? Is it AR? Is it web3? Is it all of those? For now the\n\
definition of the metaverse remains foggy, but ultimately it will\n\
be up to us to decide what it is and isn't and starts when we get\n\
together and make more content. What better place to consider all\n\
that than right here, at the nexaprism.";

export const arDescription = "AR has been a staple of science fiction for decades but not until\n\
now has it become something attainable. AR is only in its infancy\n\
but already people are thrilled at the possibilities it presents.\n\
Not limited to entertainment or gaming, it offers a lot of utility\n\
in daily situations as well as helping those with impairments or\n\
diabilities. AR represents a completely new reality that we can\n\
all inhabit and still engage with the world around us. It enhances\n\
what we already have and only time will tell what can be done with\n\
it.";

export const vrDescription = "VR has come quite a ways in recent years. Once confined to large,\n\
bulky and expensive setups in malls and arcades, VR now fits in a\n\
single headset and is as expensive as most video game consoles.\n\
The software and games on VR are also improving, both in visual\n\
quality and content. A lot of major companies have pinned their\n\
futures on the coming success of VR and expect the average\n\
household to have a headset the way TVs invaded homes in the 50s.";
