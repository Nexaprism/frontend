Welcome to the Nexaprism front end respository.

To install, simply clone the repo and run 

```
npm install
```

or 
```
yarn install
```

from there on you will need to create a .env file and add

```
REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT = <your local server ip>
```

At the current time the Nexaprism back end server is not available to download but it can be made available to anyone interested. If you are interested in using it, please contact me @ jkroslowitz@gmail.com
